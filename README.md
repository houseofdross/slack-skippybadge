Slack SkippyBadge is a small slack command to allow you to award "Skippy Badges" to your teammates.

# What the hell is a "Skippy Badge"?

A skippy badge is a bit of Australian slang for an invisible award to give to one of your friends when they
have done something great.

A typical conversation goes like this:

 - Bogan 1: "Look at this cool thing I did!"
 - Bogan 2: "What do you want? A Skippy Badge?"
 
This project is a bit different, this is a tongue-in-cheek slack command that lets you tell your friends they have
done a good job, with a bit of Australian slang for fun.
